# Instructions

These folder contains the code for moving parts according to new poses. Currently, only format of Alpha-Pose is supported and 
the version we adopted is the pytorch version on https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/pytorch.

Before using the part moving methods, please use our info to preprocess your .json pose file. Examples of using our code is provided in 
move.py.

In the future, we will add more support to other pose formats and modify the details of our implementation to make it better.
